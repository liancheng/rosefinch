# Rosefinch (朱雀)

Rosefinch is a [Twitter Bootstrap](http://twitter.github.com/bootstrap/) based Sphinx theme, specially optimized for Chinese documents.  When writing documents in languages other than Chinese -- say, English -- you can simply turn off Chinese supports by tuning theme options.

## The Game of the Name

Rosefinch (朱雀) is the ancient Chinese myth of the god of the south.  The reason why I picked this name is obvious: Twitter the bird, Sphinx the mythical creature, and all the optimizations for Chinese documents provided by this theme.
